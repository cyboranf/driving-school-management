# driving-school-management

This repository contains the REST API for a university Database course project, implemented with Spring Boot and connected to an Oracle database.

As part of the project, various database procedures were created and implemented within the application to facilitate various operations related to a driving school management system.

The application enables the user to perform operations on entities such as Courses, Instructors, Lessons, Students, Tests, Vehicle Assignments, and Vehicles. These operations are made available through a RESTful API that follows standard conventions for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting resources.

The project also features integration with Swagger UI for visual documentation and easier testing of the API endpoints. The Swagger UI documentation is accessible through the `/swagger-ui.html` endpoint when running the application.

The database schema can be found in the file `bd.txt`, and the database procedures are contained in the `procedures.txt` file.
